# Voces: Imagining The Future

Touchscreen drawing pad program to draw and save the drawing, then float around in the projected video space.

Created in Processing IDE, using a touchscreen display. Created for the Voces exhibit at OMSI.

Creating the array of images to be projected based off of the number of files in the permanentSubmissions folder is automated.
At the end of each day, a human will need to go through the submissions folder to review the drawings and remove any inappropriate images.
Then the person will need to move the approved drawings into the permanentSubmissions folder and rename them to match the incrementing file names.

If the files aren't loading for the projection, check the file path first to verify that the program is looking in the right folder.

When starting: Projection sketch must be running before the touchscreen drawing sketch in order for the drawings to be recieved.
